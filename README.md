# CS-350 Reflection
  The thermostat.py project designed to drive a thermostat using a raspberry pi 4. This project uses the GPIO pins of the raspberry pi along with several third party peripherals such as adafruit's temperature and humidity sensor. The goal of this project was to mimic the functionality of traditional thermostats including being able to read the temperature, set a temperature point, and switch between heating and cooling modes. During this project I think I did a particularly good job at writing the code to run the state machine. The area I feel I could improve the most on is documenting the breadboard connections for easier troubleshooting as well as improving the cable management of the breadboard for the same reasons. As a result of this project I added Draw.io as a part of my toolkit for making all types of technical diagrams such as state machine diagrams. I think the most valuable information from this course that will be transferable to other projects is the knowledge I gained about the different protocols involved in embedded machines such as UART, and I2C along with general knowledge about how GPIO pinouts work. To make this project more maintainable and redeemable I used programs such as Notion to track my work such as what I needed to complete and what was to be completed. Additionally I made sure to follow proper programming practices and dedicated myself to maintaining strong clean coding according to the python standards.
